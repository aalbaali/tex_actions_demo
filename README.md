# In this repo
This repo serves as a demo for using Github Actions.

The goal is to build a TeX file and upload the compiled pdf when commits are pushed to the main branch.

# TO DO
- At the moment, the pdf is uploaded in a zip file. Is it possible to upload the pdf as it is without the zip file?
- When should I use `on: push` vs `on: [push]`?
